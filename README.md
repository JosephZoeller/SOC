# SOC - SideOp Companion

SideOp Companion is a UI-driven program designed to help automate the process of creating custom sideops for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, with the goal of improving their accessibility. 

## Overview - Custom Sideops For Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain

Custom Sideops are playable, user-created side-missions which can be added to the game through TinManTex's Infinite Heaven mod. Creating custom sideops manually can be difficult, even for experienced MGSV modders. Without an acute understanding of the game's files, formats and limitations, the user can often find themselves lost and confused.

SOC, or SideOp Companion, is my attempt to automate the process of creating custom sideops. The application alleviates an immense deal of the difficult, tedious work involved in creating a custom sideop. Even with minimal understanding of the game, users can create and test their own custom sideops with relative ease. SOC can even create sideops with greater detail than those found in the base game, without even touching the game files. It's possible that this tool will make Custom Sideops the simplest and most accessible form of MGSV modding.

## The Basics - Understanding The SOC Setup Page

Upon opening SOC.exe, the user is met with the Setup Page. This page prompts the user to fill in a number of forms which are required for a custom sideop. TBC
